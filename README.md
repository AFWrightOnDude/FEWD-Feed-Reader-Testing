Feed Reader Testing Project
=========

This project demonstrates use of the Jasmine JavaScript testing framework
(https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) by providing a Jasmine testing spec file that tests the functionality
of a web app created by Udacity (www.udacity.com) that pulls news feed information using the Google Feed Reader API.

## Get Started

To launch this program, download the repository and open index.html in your
favorite browser. If you need help picking, we recommend the following:

-Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/

-Mozilla Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/

After loading the index.html file, scroll to the bottom of the page and you
will find the results of our tests contained in the file jasmine>spec>feedreader.js after
they are carried out by the Jasmine framework.

You can review the feedreader.js file along with the documentation for Jasmine located at
https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine to learn how to use Jasmine + Test Driven Development patterns
so that you can write tests for your own web apps and pages!
